    comment: `Helium is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a
        colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, the first in the noble gas
        group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements.`
  }, {
    name: 'Lithium',
    icon: 6.941,

    comment: `Lithium is a chemical element with symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft,
        silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the lightest metal and the
        lightest solid element.`

    comment: `Beryllium is a chemical element with symbol Be and atomic number 4. It is a
        relatively rare element in the universe, usually occurring as a product of the spallation of
        larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays.`
  }, {
    name: 'Boron',
    icon: 10.811,
    level: 'B',
    comment: `Boron is a chemical element with symbol B and atomic number 5. Produced entirely
        by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a
        low-abundance element in the Solar system and in the Earth's crust.`
  }, {
    name: 'Carbon',
    icon: 12.0107,
    level: 'C',
    comment: `Carbon is a chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6. It is nonmetallic
        and tetravalentâ€”making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. It belongs
        to group 14 of the periodic table.`
  }, {
    name: 'Nitrogen',
    icon: 14.0067,
    level: 'N',
    comment: `Nitrogen is a chemical element with symbol N and atomic number 7. It was first
        discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772.`
  }, {
    name: 'Oxygen',
    icon: 15.9994,
    level: 'O',
    comment: `Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of
         the chalcogen group on the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and an oxidizing
         agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds.`
  }, {
    name: 'Fluorine',
    icon: 18.9984,
    level: 'F',
    comment: `Fluorine is a chemical element with symbol F and atomic number 9. It is the
        lightest halogen and exists as a highly toxic pale yellow diatomic gas at standard
        conditions.`
  }, {
    name: 'Neon',
    icon: 20.1797,
    level: 'Ne',
    comment: `Neon is a chemical element with symbol Ne and atomic number 10. It is a noble gas.
        Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert monatomic gas under standard conditions, with about
        two-thirds the density of air.`
